              Strained yogurt, Greek yogurt, yogurt cheese, sack yogurt or
              kerned yogurt is yogurt that has been strained to remove most of

              unstrained yogurt, while still preserving the distinctive sour
              taste of yogurt. Like many types, strained yogurt is often made
              from milk enriched by boiling off some water content, or by adding
              extra butterfat and powdered milk. In Europe and North America, it
              is often made from low-fat or fat-free cow's milk. In Iceland, a
